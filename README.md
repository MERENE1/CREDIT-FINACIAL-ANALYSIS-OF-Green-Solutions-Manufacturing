# The credit and financial analysis of Green Solutions Manufacturing Ltd.
this involved a multi-stage process that evaluated the company’s earnings quality, balance sheet strength, and strategic risk profile. According to the sources, the analysis followed these key procedural steps:
## Quantitative Earnings and Profitability Analysis
The analysis began by calculating Total Revenue using the standard formula (Price per Unit × Quantity Sold) to determine the company's gross income before expenses.
• Top-line Growth: Analysts observed a 64.7% increase in revenue, rising from $34 million to $56 million.
• Operational Efficiency: The process involved evaluating EBITDA, which surged by 500%, indicating a massive improvement in core earnings power and operational cost management.
• Margin Expansion: Profitability ratios were recalculated to show that the EBITDA margin more than doubled (from 4.7% to 10.3%) and the operating margin doubled from 6% to 12%.
## Solvency and Debt-Servicing Assessment
A critical part of the credit analysis was determining the company's ability to handle existing and future debt, especially as they sought additional credit facilities.
• Interest Coverage: Analysts calculated the EBITDA Net Interest Cover, which improved from an adequate 2.8x to an exceptional 17.58x, signaling a high "margin of safety" for lenders.
• De-leveraging Review: The leverage metric (Debt-to-EBITDA) was analyzed, showing a dramatic drop from a risky 7.82 to a conservative 1.24, which significantly increased the company's creditworthiness.
• Net Cash Status: The analysis confirmed a "net cash" position, meaning the company’s cash reserves ($18 million) were compared against total liabilities to prove a low-risk financial structure.
## Balance Sheet and Liquidity Review
The analysis looked beyond the income statement to the "physical" strength of the company.
• Asset Growth: Total assets grew by 19.2%, with a specific focus on Tangible Net Worth, which increased to $31 million. This provided "hard" collateral that lenders prefer for securing financing.
• Inventory Efficiency: Analysts monitored inventory levels, which rose 50% to $6 million; they noted this growth was efficiently scaled as it was lower than the 65% revenue growth.
• Liquidity Squeeze: A downward trend in the Current Ratio (from 1.88 to 1.38) was identified, signaling that while the company is profitable, its short-term cash is increasingly tied up in long-term expansion.
## Strategic Risk and Industry Research
Finally, the analysis incorporated external market trends and internal capital allocation.
• Market Alignment: Research confirmed that the global reusable water bottle market is projected to reach $11.5 billion by 2034, with the UK market specifically benefiting from single-use plastic taxes.
• The CapEx Anomaly: A major procedural step was identifying a massive Capital Expenditure (CapEx) surge to $8 billion, which is significantly higher than the current $56 million revenue. This was flagged as a "high-stakes" execution risk because the company is betting its future on the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) from these massive projects.

### Analogy for Understanding: Think of this financial analysis as a comprehensive medical check-up for a professional athlete. The profitability analysis checked the athlete’s current speed and performance (revenue and margins), while the solvency and leverage reviews acted like a stress test for the heart (debt-servicing ability). The balance sheet review looked at bone density and muscle mass (tangible assets), and the risk assessment was like a scout looking at the difficulty of the upcoming championship race (the $8 billion expansion) to see if the athlete is prepared for the challenge.
